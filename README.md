# Horiseon Social Media Marketing Agency

#Description 
In this particular project, the goal was to go in and clean up most of the code therefore allowing the website to run smoother. What I mean by cleaning up is going in and replacing divs with semantic html elements. Also condensing the Cascading Style Sheet will allow the website to run faster than it previously did when I received the code. In the process of doing this project the learned importance of attention to detail and the leverage that double checking my work will have on future projects. I was also able to familiarize myself with both HTML and CSS therefore I feel a lot moe confident going into my next project.
